# Graph Implementations

This section covers the foundational concepts of graphs, including their definitions, types, and two primary implementations: **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List**.

## 📌 Contents

1. **Graph Definition** – Understanding what graphs are.
2. **Graph Types** – Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted, Cyclic, Acyclic, and more.
3. **Graph Representations:**
    - **Adjacency Matrix** – A 2D matrix-based representation.
    - **Adjacency List** – A list-based representation for efficient storage.

## 📝 Overview

### 1️⃣ Graph Definition

A **graph** is a data structure consisting of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**. It is commonly used in computer science to model networks, relationships, and paths.

### 2️⃣ Graph Types

Graphs can be classified into several categories:

- **Directed vs. Undirected** – Whether edges have a direction.
- **Weighted vs. Unweighted** – Whether edges have weights (values).
- **Cyclic vs. Acyclic** – Whether the graph contains cycles.
- **Connected vs. Disconnected** – Whether all vertices are reachable from any other vertex.

### 3️⃣ Graph Representations

#### 🔹 Adjacency Matrix

- Uses a **2D matrix** (NxN) where `matrix[i][j] = 1` (or weight) if there is an edge from vertex `i` to `j`, otherwise `0`.
- **Pros:** Simple to implement, quick edge lookup `O(1)`.
- **Cons:** Space-consuming for sparse graphs `O(V²)`.

##### Example:

Consider a graph with 4 vertices (0, 1, 2, 3) and edges: (0 → 1), (1 → 2), (2 → 3), (3 → 0).

**Adjacency Matrix Representation:**

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| **0** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |  
| **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |  
| **3** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  

**Visual Representation:**

```
  (0) → (1)
   ↑      ↓
  (3) ← (2)
```

#### 🔹 Adjacency List

- Uses an **array of lists**, where each index stores a list of adjacent vertices.
- **Pros:** Space-efficient for sparse graphs, better traversal performance.
- **Cons:** Edge lookup takes `O(V)`.

##### Example:

For the same graph (0 → 1, 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 0), the adjacency list representation would be:

**Adjacency List Representation:**

```
0 → 1  
1 → 2  
2 → 3  
3 → 0  
```

**Visual Representation:**

```
  0 → 1
  ↑    ↓
  3 ← 2
```
